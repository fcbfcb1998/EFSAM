Error-Filterd Segment Anything Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation

Our model relies on two models, BAM and SAM.

Firstly, clone **[BAM](https://github.com/chunbolang/BAM)**, and download datasets and model weights.

Then, clone **[SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)**, and download model weights.
